In this repository is briefly reproduced the approach proposed by: Liang, J.; Ray, S. and Shinozuka M. (2007)  Simulation of Nonstationary Stochastic Processes by Spectral Representation. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9399(2007)133:6(616)

Here, El Centro's earthquake's records are employed to assess the evolutionary PSD that describes the process, then this PSD is used to simulate several quakes. Two checks are performed using the variance and the energy. Finally an acceleration spectre is computed using the records and simulations.
